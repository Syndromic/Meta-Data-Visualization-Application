Background:
The EHR-Vendor Data Quality Specific Concerns Workgroup and Metadata Visualization App Subgroup have been developing a metadata visualization application as part of a proof of concept tool containing jurisdiction specific information on Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors, EHR  vendor products, aggregate data quality metrics(timeliness, validity and completeness), and facility types participating in syndromic surveillance. The goal is to have a tool that jurisdictions could use to help us connect and collaborate to: resolve issues in our work with EHR vendors, share best practices regarding work with different facility types including data quality success stories and challenges. The application is being developed in RStudio Professional as a Shared Project Shiny app.  Access to this application will only be available to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) Community of Practice (CoP) public health jurisdictions that choose to participate in this project, have an RStudio Professional account and been approved to access the Shared Projects Directory for the metadata visualization app, and members of the CDC NSSP teams assisting with this project. The data sources for this application are contained in each jurisdiction's NSSP Master Facility Table (MFT) Template and Data Quality Reports.
